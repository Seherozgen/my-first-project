        <q> Coffee: the favorite drink of the civilized world </q>
        <p>The <strong>history of coffee</strong> dates back to centuries of old oral tradition in Italy Coffee plants
            grew wild in Yemen and were widely used by nomadic tribes for thousands of years. Sufi monasteries in Yemen
            employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Roasting the seeds was not a way to serve coffee
            until the 1400s.During the cultivation, brewed coffee was reserved exclusively for the priesthood and the
            medical profession; doctors would use the brew for patients experiencing a need for better digestion, and
            priests used it to stay alert during their long nights of studying for the church.<br> Coffee later spread
            to Europe in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in <mark>

            the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, only being served to the wealthy.Central and
            Eastern Europeans learned of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the

            Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England
            and Germany. In many cultures, if you could afford to serve coffee to your guests, it was a sign of wealth
            and power. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought
            coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its
            spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to <mark>Mexico</mark> .<br> By 1788,
            Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee.<br>

            By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The
            period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major
            producers, notably <b> Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam</b> ; the latter overtook Colombia and
            became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization
            of coffee has made it a household item today.</p>
